## Context
The Mariia Hub booking platform required a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability, maintainability, and business logic protection. We needed to establish:

1. Clear testing guidelines and standards
2. Appropriate test coverage targets
3. Developer-friendly testing workflows
4. Quality assurance processes
5. Performance and accessibility testing integration

### Business Requirements
- Protect booking flow integrity (critical revenue path)
- Ensure payment processing reliability
- Maintain user experience quality across devices
- Support rapid development without sacrificing quality
- Enable confident refactoring and feature additions

### Technical Challenges
- Complex booking workflow with multiple steps
- Integration with external services (Supabase, Stripe, Booksy)
- Multi-language support (PL/EN/UA/RU)
- Real-time features and state management
- Performance requirements for luxury market positioning

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Testing Approach**
   - Focus only on critical business paths
   - Low coverage requirements (30-40%)
   - Manual QA for most features
   - Fast development, higher risk

2. **Comprehensive Testing (Chosen)**
   - 70% meaningful coverage target
   - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Performance and accessibility testing
   - Test-first development workflows

3. **Testing Parity (100%)**
   - 100% line coverage requirement
   - Extensive mutation testing
   - Formal verification processes
   - High overhead, diminishing returns

## Decision
Adopt a **comprehensive but pragmatic testing strategy** focused on meaningful coverage and developer experience.

### Core Principles
- **Quality with Purpose**: Tests should protect business value, not just coverage numbers
- **Developer Experience**: Fast, reliable tests with excellent tooling
- **Business Logic Protection**: Heavy focus on booking flow and payment processing
- **Accessibility by Default**: Automated a11y testing for all components
- **Performance Awareness**: Test performance characteristics of critical components

### Testing Pyramid Distribution
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Business logic, utilities, component behavior
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Service interactions, data flow
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical user journeys, cross-browser testing

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Higher Quality**: Comprehensive testing catches issues early
- **Developer Confidence**: Enables refactoring and feature additions
- **Business Protection**: Critical paths thoroughly tested
- **Accessibility**: Automated a11y testing ensures compliance
- **Performance**: Performance testing prevents regressions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

### Negative Consequences
- **Development Overhead**: Writing and maintaining tests takes time
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn testing patterns and tools
- **Test Maintenance**: Tests require updates as code evolves
- **CI Complexity**: More comprehensive testing pipeline
- **Coverage Pressure**: Risk of focusing on metrics over value

### Implementation Challenges
- **Test Flakiness**: Need to ensure reliable, deterministic tests
- **Mock Management**: Complex mocking for external dependencies
- **Performance Balance**: Fast test execution vs comprehensive testing
- **Team Adoption**: Ensuring consistent testing practices across team

## Implementation Notes

### Coverage Targets
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
coverage: {
  thresholds: {
    global: {
      branches: 60,    // Working toward 70%
      functions: 60,   // Working toward 70%
      lines: 60,       // Working toward 70%
      statements: 60,  // Working toward 70%
    },
  },
}
```

### Test Organization Standards
```
src/
├── test/                      # Global testing infrastructure
│   ├── setup-vitest.ts        # Global test configuration
│   ├── utils/                 # Reusable testing utilities
│   └── factories/            # Test data factories

├── lib/__tests__/            # Utility function tests
└── pages/__tests__/          # Page-level integration tests
```

### Testing Standards

#### 1. Unit Testing
- Test business logic, not implementation details
- Use meaningful assertions
- Mock external dependencies
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for 80-90% coverage on business logic

#### 2. Component Testing
- Test user interactions and behavior
- Use Testing Library best practices
- Test accessibility requirements
- Include loading and error states
- Mock API responses appropriately

#### 3. Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between components
- Test service layer integrations
- Include authentication/authorization flows
- Test error handling and recovery

#### 4. E2E Testing
- Focus on critical user journeys
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Include mobile/responsive testing
- Test real-world scenarios
- Use meaningful data and scenarios

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Linting, affected tests, type checking
- **Pre-merge**: Full test suite, coverage requirements
- **Pre-deploy**: E2E tests, performance tests, security scans
- **Production**: Monitoring, error tracking, performance alerts

### Testing Workflows

#### Test-First Development (Preferred)
1. Write failing test for new feature/bug
2. Implement minimum code to make test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Review and optimize test quality

#### Test-After Development (When Necessary)
1. Implement feature without tests (emergency fixes)
2. Write comprehensive tests immediately after
3. Refactor if test coverage reveals issues
4. Add regression tests to prevent future issues

### Developer Experience
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests run quickly in watch mode
- **Helpful Errors**: Clear test failure messages
- **Tooling Support**: IDE integration, VSCode extensions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing guides and examples
- **Templates**: Test templates for common patterns
