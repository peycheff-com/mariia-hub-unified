## Overview

The Mariia Hub Accessibility User Testing Framework provides a structured approach to testing our beauty and fitness booking platform with people with disabilities. This framework ensures we gather meaningful feedback to create an inclusive experience for all users.

### Testing Objectives
- Validate accessibility improvements with real users
- Identify barriers not detected by automated tools
- Gather qualitative feedback on user experience
- Test complete user journeys with assistive technology
- Build empathy and understanding within the development team

### Target Standards
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance validation
- Real-world usability for people with disabilities
- Inclusive design best practices
- Accessibility innovation and thought leadership

## Testing Methodology

### Mixed-Methods Approach

We combine multiple testing methodologies to get comprehensive insights:

#### 1. Moderated Remote Testing
- **When**: New features, major redesigns
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes per session
- **Facilitator**: Live guidance and probing
- **Benefits**: Rich qualitative data, ability to ask follow-up questions

#### 2. Unmoderated Testing
- **When**: Ongoing validation, quick feedback
- **Duration**: 20-30 minutes per session
- **Facilitator**: None, automated prompts
- **Benefits**: Scalable, natural behavior, cost-effective

#### 3. Contextual Inquiry
- **When**: Understanding user environments
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours in user's environment
- **Facilitator**: Observer and interviewer
- **Benefits**: Deep understanding of real-world usage

#### 4. A/B Accessibility Testing
- **When**: Comparing design solutions
- **Duration**: 1 week per variant
- **Facilitator**: Analytics-driven
- **Benefits**: Data-driven accessibility decisions

### Testing Environments

#### In-Person Testing
- **Location**: Usability lab or quiet meeting room
- **Equipment**: Various assistive technologies
- **Benefits**: Full control over environment, immediate observation
- **Challenges**: Logistics, limited geography

#### Remote Testing
- **Platform**: Video conferencing with screen sharing
- **Equipment**: User's own setup
- **Benefits**: Geographic diversity, real-world environment
- **Challenges**: Technical issues, limited observation

#### Field Testing
- **Location**: User's home or workplace
- **Equipment**: User's typical setup
- **Benefits**: Most authentic environment
- **Challenges**: Logistics, privacy concerns

1. This session will be recorded for internal analysis only
2. Your personal information will be kept confidential
3. You can request your data be deleted at any time
4. You're free to stop participation without penalty
5. We'll provide compensation of [Amount] for your time

Your participation helps us create a more accessible platform for everyone. Do you consent to these terms and proceed with the testing?"
```

### During-Test Protocol

#### Facilitation Guidelines

**Think-Aloud Technique**
- Prompt participants to verbalize their thoughts
- Ask open-ended questions about expectations
- Encourage sharing of frustrations and successes
- Avoid leading questions or solutions

**Observation Focus Areas**
```typescript
interface ObservationAreas {
  navigation: {
    pathEfficiency: boolean
    confusionPoints: string[]
    workarounds: string[]
    successStrategies: string[]
  }
  assistiveTechnology: {
    toolCompatibility: boolean
    announcementQuality: boolean
    navigationMethods: string[]
    limitations: string[]
  }
  emotionalResponse: {
    frustrationLevel: number // 1-5 scale
    confidenceLevel: number // 1-5 scale

  }
  performance: {
    taskCompletionTime: number
    errorCount: number
    helpRequired: boolean
    successfulWorkarounds: number
  }
}
```

**Intervention Guidelines**
- Only intervene when participant is completely stuck
- Offer hints rather than solutions
- Document when and why interventions occurred
- Resume normal observation after intervention

#### Question Prompts

**General Probes**
- "What were you expecting to happen when you did that?"
- "Can you tell me more about what you're thinking right now?"
- "How does this compare to other websites you've used?"
- "What would make this experience better for you?"

**Specific Probes by Disability Type**
- **Screen Reader Users**: "How did the screen reader announce that element?"
- **Keyboard Users**: "Could you find everything you needed using just the keyboard?"
- **Voice Control Users**: "Did the voice commands work as you expected?"
- **Low Vision Users**: "How is the color contrast working for you?"

### Post-Test Protocol

#### Debrief Interview (15-20 minutes)

**Overall Experience**
1. "On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your overall experience?"
2. "What was the most frustrating part of the experience?"
3. "What worked surprisingly well?"
4. "What would you change if you could redesign anything?"

**Specific Accessibility Feedback**
1. "How well did your assistive technology work with the platform?"
2. "Were there any features that were particularly accessible or inaccessible?"
3. "Did you encounter any barriers that prevented you from completing tasks?"
4. "What accessibility features would you like to see added?"

**Comparison Questions**
1. "How does this experience compare to other booking platforms you've used?"
2. "What websites do you find particularly accessible? Why?"
3. "Are there any specific accessibility features you particularly value?"

**Future Input**
1. "Would you be interested in participating in future testing?"
2. "Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about your experience?"
3. "Do you have suggestions for how we could improve our testing process?"
