## 3. Testing Tools & Implementation

### 3.1 A/B Testing Architecture

```typescript
// A/B Testing Configuration
interface ABTest {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  hypothesis: string;
  variants: {
    control: ComponentConfig;
    variant: ComponentConfig;
  };
  trafficSplit: number; // 0-100
  targetAudience?: UserSegment[];
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  status: 'draft' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'paused';
  results?: TestResults;
}

// Example Test Configuration
const heroTest: ABTest = {
  id: 'hero-headline-2024-01',
  name: 'Hero Headline Test',
  hypothesis: 'Benefit-oriented headline will increase CTR by 10%',
  variants: {
    control: {
      title: 'Premium Beauty Services in Warsaw',

};
```

### 3.2 Implementation Components

#### 3.2.1 Test Provider
```typescript
// src/components/testing/ABTestProvider.tsx
export const ABTestProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  // Handle test assignment and tracking
};
```

#### 3.2.2 Test Wrapper
```typescript
// src/components/testing/ABTest.tsx
export const ABTest: React.FC<{
  testId: string;
  children: (variant: 'control' | 'variant') => React.ReactNode;
}> = ({ testId, children }) => {
  // Render appropriate variant
};
```

#### 3.2.3 Analytics Integration
```typescript
// Track test events
track('ABTestViewed', {
  testId: 'hero-headline-2024-01',
  variant: 'control',
  userId: user.id
});

track('ABTestConverted', {
  testId: 'hero-headline-2024-01',
  variant: 'control',
  conversionType: 'booking_completed',
