# Session 2: Payment Integration & Business Logic Refactoring

## Mission Overview
This session focuses on **CRITICAL business logic fixes** and implementing real payment processing. The platform currently has simulated payments which represents a business model failure. We'll also address race conditions, booking flows, and conversion optimization opportunities.

## Critical Issues to Resolve
- ðŸ”´ **Simulated payment processing** - No real Stripe integration
- ðŸ”´ **Auto-submission risk** - Bookings submit without explicit confirmation
- ðŸŸ¡ **Race conditions** in availability system
- ðŸŸ¡ **Missing confirmation step** in booking flow
- ðŸŸ¢ **Conversion optimization** opportunities (guest checkout, express booking)
