## üî¥ Critical Security Fixes (Priority 1)

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets Removal ‚úÖ FIXED

**Issue**: Hardcoded API keys, secrets, and tokens in source code

**Files Fixed**:
- `.env.stripe.bmbeauty:13` - Stripe webhook secret replaced with placeholder
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts:6` - JWT token replaced with environment variables

**Impact**: Eliminated risk of credential exposure in version control

### 2. XSS Vulnerability Elimination ‚úÖ FIXED

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/components/media/ModelConsentForm.tsx` - Removed dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- `browser-extension/booksy-data-extractor/content.js` - Replaced 8 instances of innerHTML

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced dangerouslySetInnerHTML with safe text rendering
- Created safe DOM manipulation helper functions
- Used createElementNS for SVG creation
- Eliminated all innerHTML assignments

**Impact**: Complete XSS attack vector elimination

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention ‚úÖ FIXED

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/services/resourceAllocation.service.ts:493` - Fixed dynamic array to string conversion
- `src/services/search.service.ts` - Added input sanitization for .ilike() patterns

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced string interpolation with parameterized queries
- Added input sanitization and validation
- Escaped SQL wildcards and removed dangerous characters
- Limited input length to prevent buffer overflow

**Impact**: SQL injection attack protection

### 4. Weak Random Generation Fix ‚úÖ FIXED

**File Fixed**:
- `src/services/api/v1/payment-routes.ts` - Replaced Math.random() with crypto.getRandomValues()

**Changes Made**:
- Implemented cryptographically secure random string generation
- Used Web Crypto API for payment intent ID generation
- Added proper entropy for security-sensitive operations

**Impact**: Enhanced cryptographic security

## üü° Security Improvements (Priority 2)

### 5. Security Headers Middleware ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**File Created**: `src/middleware/security-middleware.ts`

**Features**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options for clickjacking protection
- X-Content-Type-Options for MIME sniffing protection
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration
- Rate limiting for DoS protection

### 6. Comprehensive Security Scanner ‚úÖ CREATED

**File Created**: `scripts/security-scan-comprehensive.js`

**Scanning Capabilities**:
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- XSS vulnerability identification
- SQL injection pattern detection
- Weak random generation identification
- Log injection vulnerability scanning
- Automated CI/CD integration

**Usage**: `node scripts/security-scan-comprehensive.js`

### 7. Docker Security Verification ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Finding**: Docker compose files already use environment variables properly
**Status**: No hardcoded passwords found - good security practices already in place

---

## üîµ Security Best Practices (Priority 3)

### 8. Input Validation Framework ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Improvements**:
- Added input sanitization for search queries
- Implemented length restrictions on user inputs
- Escaped dangerous characters in SQL queries
- Created validation helper functions

### 9. Security Documentation ‚úÖ CREATED

**Documents Created**:
- `docs/SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- Security scanning script documentation
- Implementation guidelines for developers

### 10. Error Handling Security ‚úÖ IMPROVED

**Improvements**:
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Removed sensitive information from error responses
- Implemented proper error logging without exposing secrets

## üîí Recommended Security Practices

### For Development Team

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Run security scanner** before each commit
4. **Review code** for XSS and SQL injection patterns
5. **Use secure random generation** for any security-sensitive operations

### For Operations Team

1. **Configure CI/CD** to run security scanner automatically
2. **Set up monitoring** for security headers
3. **Regular security audits** with the scanning tool
4. **Keep dependencies** up to date
5. **Monitor for new vulnerabilities** in dependencies

### For Production Environment

1. **Enable security headers** on all API endpoints
2. **Implement rate limiting** for sensitive operations
3. **Monitor security logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Regular secret rotation** for production credentials
5. **Security testing** in staging environment
