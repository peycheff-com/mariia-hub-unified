# Booksy Migration Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating your business and client data from Booksy to your new booking platform. Since Booksy doesn't provide a public API or export functionality, we've developed a comprehensive CSV-based migration solution.

## üéØ Before You Begin

### What You'll Need
- ‚úÖ Admin access to your Booksy business account
- ‚úÖ Your new platform admin access
- ‚úÖ Basic spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets)
- ‚úÖ About 2-4 hours for initial data entry

### Data Priority Order
1. **High-value clients** (most recent and loyal customers)
2. **Upcoming appointments** (next 30-60 days)
3. **Service catalog** (full price list and descriptions)
4. **Staff schedules** (availability and specializations)
5. **Historical data** (past appointments for analytics)

## üìä Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data Template

1. Download the import template from your admin panel:
   - Go to Admin ‚Üí Data Operations ‚Üí Import/Export
   - Click "Download Template"
   - Save as `booking-import-template.csv`

2. Open in Excel or Google Sheets

### Step 2: Extract Data from Booksy

#### Method A: Manual Data Entry (Recommended for < 200 appointments)
1. **Open Booksy Business Dashboard** in your browser
2. **Go to Appointments** section
3. **For each appointment:**
   - Copy client name, email, phone
   - Copy service name
   - Copy date and time
   - Note any special requests
4. **Paste into your spreadsheet**
5. **Save as CSV** when complete

#### Method B: Copy/Paste Export (Faster for large datasets)
1. **Display 100 appointments per page** in Booksy
2. **Select All** (Ctrl+A) and Copy (Ctrl+C)
3. **Paste into Excel**
4. **Use Text to Columns** feature (Data > Text to Columns)
   - Delimiter: Comma
   - Format headers properly
5. **Clean up data** (remove extra columns)

#### Method C: Browser Developer Tools (Technical)
```javascript
// Paste this in Booksy's console (F12)
const appointments = [];
document.querySelectorAll('.appointment-item').forEach(item => {
  appointments.push({
    name: item.querySelector('.client-name')?.textContent,
    service: item.querySelector('.service-name')?.textContent,
    date: item.querySelector('.appointment-date')?.textContent,
    time: item.querySelector('.appointment-time')?.textContent,
    email: item.querySelector('.client-email')?.textContent,
    phone: item.querySelector('.client-phone')?.textContent
  });
});
console.table(appointments);
copy(JSON.stringify(appointments));
```

### Step 3: Clean and Format Your Data

1. **Required Fields:**
   - `Client Name` ‚úÖ
   - `Service Name` ‚úÖ
   - `Date (YYYY-MM-DD)` ‚úÖ
   - `Time (HH:MM)` ‚úÖ

2. **Optional Fields:**
   - `Client Email`
   - `Client Phone`
   - `Duration (minutes)`
   - `Price (PLN)`
   - `Status` (confirmed, cancelled, completed)
   - `Notes`

3. **Common Issues and Fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|--------|------|
| Date format wrong | Use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-01-15) |
| Time with AM/PM | Convert to 24-hour format (e.g., 2:30 PM = 14:30) |
| Names with commas | Enclose in quotes (e.g., "Doe, John") |
| Polish characters | Save CSV as UTF-8 |
| Multiple services | Create separate rows for each service |

### Step 4: Import Your Data

1. **Go to Admin ‚Üí Data Operations ‚Üí Import/Export**
2. **Select your CSV file**
3. **Run "Preview Import" first**
   - Check for errors
   - Validate data
   - Fix any issues
4. **Click "Import Bookings"**
   - Monitor progress
   - Address any errors

### Step 5: Verify Import

1. **Check recent bookings** in your calendar
2. **Verify client information** in client list
3. **Confirm service prices** match
4. **Test booking process** with sample data
