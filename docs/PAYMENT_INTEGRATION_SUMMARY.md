## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# Security Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-domain.com"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-domain.com,https://*.your-domain.com"

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

## Database Schema Updates

The following tables should exist (or be created) for full functionality:

- `payment_intents` - Store payment intent records
- `payment_charges` - Store successful charge records
- `payment_disputes` - Store dispute information
- `stripe_customers` - Store customer records
- `webhook_logs` - Store webhook event logs
- `payment_methods` - Store saved payment methods
