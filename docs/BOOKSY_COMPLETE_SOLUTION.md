### Integration Points
1. **Chrome Extension**:
   - Manual installation in browser
   - Works immediately
   - Best for ongoing data extraction

2. **Python Automation**:
   - Requires Python and Selenium
   - Best for one-time large migration
   - Handles multi-month extraction

3. **Built-in Import Tool**:
   - Integrated into admin panel
   - Use for ongoing CSV imports
   - Validate and clean data

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Chrome Extension
1. **Extract Monthly**: Run at end of each month
2. **Auto-Sync**: Extract new appointments weekly
3. **Team Extraction**: Have all staff install extension

### For Python Automation
1. **Schedule Overnight**: Run when Booksy traffic is low
2. **Use Proxies**: Rotate IP addresses if needed
3. **Break It Up**: Don't extract all 12 months at once

### For Data Quality
1. **Validate First**: Always preview imports
2. **Clean Data**: Remove duplicates and fix errors
3. **Test Imports**: Start with small batches
4. **Monitor**: Check for issues in first week

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Booksy Account Protection
