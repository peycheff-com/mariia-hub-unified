2. **Initial Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   curl -f https://mariia-hub.com/health
   curl -f https://api.mariia-hub.com/health

   # Check Vercel status
   curl https://www.vercel-status.com/api/v2/status.json

   # Check Supabase status

   - If database issue: Switch to read-only mode
   - If third-party: Implement fallback

### 2. High Severity Incident (SEV-1)

**First Hour:**
1. **Investigate Root Cause**
   - Review logs in Vercel
   - Check API response times
   - Analyze database performance

2. **Implement Fix**
   - Hotfix deployment
   - Configuration change
   - Temporary workaround

3. **Monitor**
   - Watch error rates
   - Monitor user reports
   - Check system metrics

## Common Incident Scenarios

### Database Connection Failure

**Symptoms:**
- 503 errors on booking endpoints
- Timeout errors
- Failed database queries

**Response:**
```bash
# 1. Check Supabase status
curl https://status.supabase.com/api/v2/status.json

# 2. Test database connection
npx supabase db shell --command "SELECT 1;"

# 3. Check connection pool
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

# 4. If connection pool exhausted:
-- Kill long-running queries
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
AND query_start < now() - interval '5 minutes';
```

**Recovery:**
1. Restart application if connection pool corrupted
2. Scale up database resources if needed
3. Implement connection retry logic

### Payment Processing Failure

**Symptoms:**
- Booking failures at payment step
- Stripe webhook errors
- Payment confirmation timeouts

**Response:**
```bash
# 1. Check Stripe status
curl https://status.stripe.com/api/v2/status.json

# 2. Verify Stripe keys
echo $VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# 3. Check webhook endpoints
curl -X POST https://mariia-hub.com/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Stripe-Signature: test"
```

**Recovery:**
1. Verify API keys are correct
2. Check webhook URL configuration
3. Review recent Stripe changes
4. Fallback to manual payment confirmation

### Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Login failures
- Session timeouts
- Auth token errors

**Response:**
```bash
# 1. Check Supabase Auth status
curl https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{project-id}/auth/status

# 2. Test auth flow
curl -X POST https://{project-ref}.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password \
  -H "apikey: {anon-key}" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "test"}'

# 3. Check JWT settings
SELECT * FROM auth.config WHERE key LIKE '%jwt%';
```

**Recovery:**
1. Refresh JWT secret if expired
2. Check RLS policies
3. Verify auth configuration

### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Slow page loads
- High response times
- Timeouts

**Response:**
```bash
# 1. Check Core Web Vitals
curl -s https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://mariia-hub.com

# 2. Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# 3. Check Vercel Edge performance
vercel logs --filter=error

# 4. Monitor database queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Recovery:**
1. Enable aggressive caching
2. Optimize database queries
3. Scale up infrastructure
4. Implement loading states

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. List recent deployments
vercel ls

# 2. Identify last stable deployment
vercel inspect {deployment-url}

# 3. Promote stable deployment
vercel promote {stable-deployment-url}

# 4. Verify rollback
curl -f https://mariia-hub.com/health
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# 1. Create backup before rollback
npx supabase db dump --data-only > backup.sql

# 2. Rollback migration
npx supabase migration rollback

# 3. Verify data integrity
npx supabase db shell --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings;"
```
