## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. Automated Testing Integration

#### Component-Level Testing
```typescript
// Example: React component accessibility test
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'

test('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<BookingComponent />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

#### E2E Testing with Playwright
```typescript
// Example: Comprehensive page testing
test('should be accessible across all viewports', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/booking')
  await injectAxe(page)
  await checkA11y(page, undefined, {
    includedImpacts: ['critical', 'serious']
  })
})
```
