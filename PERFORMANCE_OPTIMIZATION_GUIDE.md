# Supabase Backend Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive performance optimization implemented for the Mariia Hub booking system, targeting sub-100ms response times for critical queries and scalable architecture for high-demand periods in the Warsaw beauty/fitness market.

## Architecture Overview

### Optimized Components

1. **Database Layer**: Advanced indexing, materialized views, and optimized functions
2. **Client Layer**: Enhanced Supabase client with caching and performance monitoring
3. **Real-time Layer**: Efficient WebSocket connection management
4. **Storage Layer**: Optimized file uploads with CDN integration
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Comprehensive performance tracking and alerting

## Database Optimizations

### 1. Advanced Indexing Strategy

```sql
-- Composite indexes for booking queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_availability_slots_composite
ON availability_slots (service_id, date, is_available, start_time)
WHERE is_available = true;

-- User booking queries optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bookings_user_status_date
ON bookings (user_id, status, booking_date DESC)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'completed');
```

### 2. Materialized Views

```sql
-- Recent bookings materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_recent_bookings AS
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE booking_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
WITH DATA;

-- Active services with analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_active_services AS
SELECT s.*, COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) as booking_count, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
FROM services s
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON s.id = b.service_id AND b.status = 'completed'
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON s.id = r.service_id AND r.is_public = true
WHERE s.is_active = true
GROUP BY s.id;
```

### 3. Optimized Database Functions

```sql
-- High-performance availability checking
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_availability_optimized(
  p_service_id UUID,
  p_start_date DATE,
  p_end_date DATE,
  p_location_type location_type DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS TABLE (...) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT aslot.id, aslot.date, aslot.start_time, aslot.end_time,
         aslot.is_available, aslot.capacity,
         COALESCE(bcount.booking_count, 0) as current_bookings
  FROM availability_slots aslot
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT b.booking_date, b.start_time, COUNT(*) as booking_count
    FROM bookings b
    WHERE b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending')
      AND b.booking_date BETWEEN p_start_date AND p_end_date
      AND b.service_id = p_service_id
    GROUP BY b.booking_date, b.start_time
  ) bcount ON aslot.date = bcount.booking_date
              AND aslot.start_time = bcount.start_time
  WHERE aslot.service_id = p_service_id
    AND aslot.date BETWEEN p_start_date AND p_end_date
    AND aslot.is_available = true
    AND (aslot.capacity > COALESCE(bcount.booking_count, 0))
  ORDER BY aslot.date, aslot.start_time;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Client Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client

The optimized client (`client-optimized.ts`) includes:

- **Query caching** with configurable TTL
- **Performance monitoring** for all database operations
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Connection pooling** optimization
- **Batch operations** support

```typescript
// Example usage with caching
const result = await supabaseOptimized.queryWithMonitoring(
  'get_active_services',
  () => supabaseOptimized.baseClient
    .from('services')
    .select('*')
    .eq('is_active', true),
  {
    cacheKey: 'active_services',
    cacheTTL: 10 * 60 * 1000 // 10 minutes
  }
);
```

### 2. Real-time Connection Management

Optimized real-time subscriptions with:

- **Connection pooling** (max 10 concurrent subscriptions)
- **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Event batching** for reduced processing overhead
- **Health monitoring** and cleanup of inactive connections

```typescript
// Subscribe to booking updates
const subscriptionId = realtimeManager.subscribeToUserBookings(
  userId,
  (payload) => handleBookingUpdate(payload)
);
```

### 3. Storage and CDN Optimization

Optimized file handling with:

- **Automatic image compression** and resizing
- **Thumbnail generation** for multiple sizes
- **CDN integration** for static assets
- **Batch upload** processing
- **Cache control** headers optimization

```typescript
// Upload optimized image
const result = await uploadServiceImage(file, {
  transform: {
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    quality: 85,
    format: 'webp'
  }
});
```

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Comprehensive Metrics Tracking

The monitoring system tracks:

- **Database performance**: Query times, cache hit rates, slow queries
- **API performance**: Response times, error rates, endpoint performance
- **User experience**: Page load times, Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **System resources**: Memory usage, network latency

### 2. Real-time Alerting

Automatic alerts for:

- **Slow queries** (>100ms)
- **High error rates** (>5%)
- **Poor user experience** (>3s page load)
- **System resource issues** (>80% memory usage)

### 3. Performance Reports

Automated reports include:

- **Trend analysis** over time
- **Performance insights** and recommendations
- **Health scoring** (excellent/good/fair/poor)
- **Bottleneck identification**

## Booking System Optimizations

### 1. Conflict Prevention

- **Temporary holds** on time slots (5-minute reservation)
- **Optimistic locking** for concurrent bookings
- **Batch processing** for multiple bookings
- **Conflict detection** with alternative suggestions

### 2. Advanced Caching

- **Multi-level caching**: Browser, application, and CDN
- **Cache invalidation** on data changes
- **Intelligent cache warming** for popular queries
- **Cache hit rate optimization**

### 3. Batch Operations

```typescript
// Process multiple bookings efficiently
const result = await createBatchBookings(bookings, {
  processImmediately: true,
  priority: 'high'
});
```
