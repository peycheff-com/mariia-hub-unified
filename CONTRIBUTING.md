   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- **New features**: Create an issue with the "enhancement" label
- **Bug fixes**: Create an issue with the "bug" label
- **Documentation**: Create an issue with the "documentation" label

### 2. Claim the Issue

- Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on it
- Wait for assignment from maintainers

### 3. Create Your Branch

Use the following naming conventions:
- `feature/short-description` - New features
- `fix/short-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/short-description` - Code refactoring
- `test/short-description` - Test additions
- `chore/short-description` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Make Your Changes

Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards) and ensure your code is well-tested.

### 5. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid using `any` type - use proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for constants with semantic meaning

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React Hooks rules
- Use memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) for performance
- Keep components small and focused

### Naming Conventions

```typescript
// Components - PascalCase
export const BookingWizard = () => {};

// Hooks - camelCase starting with "use"
export const useBookingState = () => {};

// Functions - camelCase
const calculateAvailability = () => {};

// Constants - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_BOOKING_DURATION = 3600;

// Files - kebab-case
// booking-wizard.tsx
// use-booking-state.ts
// api-constants.ts
```

### Code Organization

```typescript
// Import order
// 1. React imports
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// 3. Internal imports (use @ alias)
import { BookingType } from '@/types/booking';
import { useBookingContext } from '@/contexts/BookingContext';

// 4. Relative imports
import './BookingWizard.css';
```

### Comments and JSDoc

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price for a booking including discounts and taxes
 * @param basePrice - The base price of the service
 * @param duration - Duration in minutes
 * @param discount - Optional discount percentage (0-100)
 * @param currency - Currency code for conversion
 * @returns The final price formatted with currency symbol
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const price = calculateBookingPrice(100, 60, 10, 'PLN');
 * console.log(price); // '90.00 z≈Ç'
 * ```
 */
export const calculateBookingPrice = (
  basePrice: number,
  duration: number,
  discount = 0,
  currency = 'PLN'
): string => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### CSS and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes whenever possible
- Use CSS-in-JS only for dynamic styles
- Follow the 8px grid system for spacing
- Use semantic color variables from the theme

```tsx
// Good - Using Tailwind
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 bg-background rounded-lg shadow-sm">

// Avoid - Inline styles
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '16px' }}>
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functions and components
- Use Vitest and Testing Library
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BookingWizard } from './BookingWizard';

describe('BookingWizard', () => {
  it('renders all booking steps', () => {
    render(<BookingWizard />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Choose Service')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Select Time')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('navigates between steps correctly', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Test user flows and interactions
- Use mock data for consistent testing
- Test error states and edge cases

### E2E Tests

- Write E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Use Playwright for browser automation
- Test mobile and desktop views
