# Advanced Multi-Agent Repository Review

Execute a comprehensive end-to-end repository review using advanced agent capabilities and parallel processing. This review will leverage specialized skills and simultaneous agent deployment for maximum coverage.

## Agent Deployment Strategy

### **Primary Agents (Launch Simultaneously)**

#### **Agent 1: Code Review & Architecture Specialist**
```bash
/subagent:dispatching-parallel-agents
```
**Mission**: Evaluate codebase architecture, patterns, and technical debt
- Review React 18 + TypeScript implementation quality
- Assess shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS usage patterns
- Analyze state management (Context + React Query)
- Evaluate component organization and reusability
- Check for code smells and anti-patterns
- Review API integration patterns

#### **Agent 2: Security & Compliance Auditor**
```bash
/skill:systematic-debugging
```
**Mission**: Comprehensive security analysis
- Authentication & authorization review
- GDPR compliance assessment
- Input validation and XSS protection
- Supabase RLS policies audit
- Stripe security integration review
- Environment variable and secret management
- CORS and CSP implementation analysis

#### **Agent 3: Performance & Scalability Expert**
```bash
/skill:verification-before-completion
```
**Mission**: Performance optimization analysis
- Bundle size optimization review
- Vite build configuration audit
- Image optimization and CDN readiness
- Database query performance analysis
- Service worker and PWA implementation
- Mobile performance optimization
- Lighthouse score assessment

#### **Agent 4: Testing Strategy Analyst**
```bash
/skill:test-driven-development
```
**Mission**: Testing architecture and coverage review
- Vitest configuration analysis
- Component testing strategy review
- Integration testing coverage
- Mock implementation quality
- E2E testing setup assessment
- Test coverage metrics analysis

#### **Agent 5: Business Logic & Domain Expert**
```bash
/skill:brainstorming
```
**Mission**: Business workflow validation
- 4-step booking wizard analysis
- Real-time availability system review
- Payment flow validation
- Booksy integration assessment
- Multi-language support validation
- Admin dashboard functionality review

### **Secondary Support Skills (Apply as needed)**

#### **Code Quality Enhancement**
```bash
/skill:using-superpowers
```
Apply when identifying improvement opportunities and best practices

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
```bash
/skill:root-cause-tracing
```
Use for deep-diving into complex issues discovered by primary agents

#### **Testing Anti-Patterns**
```bash
/skill:testing-anti-patterns
```
Apply when evaluating testing strategy and implementation

#### **Documentation Review**
```bash
/elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely
```
Use for reviewing documentation clarity and technical writing

## Execution Plan

### **Phase 1: Parallel Agent Deployment**
1. Launch all 5 primary agents simultaneously with distinct missions
2. Each agent uses appropriate specialized skills for their domain
3. Agents work in parallel to maximize coverage and efficiency

### **Phase 2: Skill-Based Augmentation**
1. Apply specialized skills based on initial findings
2. Use systematic debugging for complex issues
3. Leverage test-driven development principles for testing gaps
4. Apply brainstorming for business logic improvements

### **Phase 3: Cross-Agent Synthesis**
1. Consolidate findings from all agents
2. Identify overlapping concerns and priorities
3. Create unified action plan with clear sequencing
4. Generate comprehensive report with executive summary
